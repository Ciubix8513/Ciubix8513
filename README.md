I've been programming in one way or another since I was 6, tho I didn't start writing actual code until I was ~12


Computer graphics is my favourite thing to code, I just love that you can *actually* see what you're doing


I have expirience with quite a lot of stuff:
  - Unity, Unreal engine 
  - C#,C++,Java
  - Lua, Javascript, Brainfuck
  - OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan
  - HLSL, GLSL
